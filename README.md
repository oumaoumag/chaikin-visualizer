# chaikin

Chaikin's algorithm is a curve subdivision algorithm that smooths a polyline or polygon by "cutting corners" - replacing each corner with two new points.

## Understanding Chaikin's Algorithm and Project Requirements
Based on the information I've gathered, I understand that:

Chaikin's algorithm is a curve subdivision algorithm that smooths a polyline or polygon by "cutting corners" - replacing each corner with two new points.
The project requires:
- Creating a canvas where users can draw points
- Implementing Chaikin's algorithm to smooth the curve formed by these points
- Animating the steps of the algorithm (7 steps)
- Handling user input (mouse clicks for points, Enter to start animation, Escape to quit)
- Special cases for 1 or 2 points
The animation should cycle through the steps of Chaikin's algorithm, showing how the curve evolves.

## Implementation Plan
1. Project Setup
   - Create a new Rust project using Cargo:
     ```
     cargo new chaikin_animation
     cd chaikin_animation
     ```
   - Add a graphics library dependency to Cargo.toml. Based on my research, macroquad seems like a good choice for this project as it's simple to use and cross-platform.

2. Core Components
   - Point Management:
     - Create a structure to store the control points
     - Implement functions to add points via mouse clicks
     - Implement functions to draw points on the canvas
   - Chaikin's Algorithm Implementation:
     - Implement the core algorithm to generate new points by cutting corners
     - Create a function that can apply the algorithm iteratively
   - Animation System:
     - Create a state machine to manage the animation states (drawing points, animating, etc.)
     - Implement a timer to control the animation speed
     - Create functions to draw each step of the algorithm
   - User Interface:
     - Handle mouse input for placing points
     - Handle keyboard input (Enter to start animation, Escape to quit)
     - Implement visual feedback for user actions

3. Detailed Implementation Steps
   - Set up the basic application structure:
     - Create the main loop
     - Initialize the window and graphics context
     - Set up the state management
   - Implement point drawing and management:
     - Create a data structure to store points
     - Implement mouse click detection to add points
     - Draw points on the canvas
   - Implement Chaikin's algorithm:
     - Create a function to apply one iteration of Chaikin's algorithm
     - Store intermediate results for animation
   - Implement the animation system:
     - Create a timer to control animation speed
     - Implement drawing of intermediate steps
     - Create a loop to cycle through the animation steps
   - Handle special cases:
     - Implement special handling for 1 point (just show the point)
     - Implement special handling for 2 points (draw a straight line)
   - Implement user controls:
     - Enter key to start animation
     - Escape key to quit
     - Optional: Clear screen functionality
     - Optional: Point dragging
   - Polish and optimize:
     - Add visual feedback
     - Optimize performance
     - Add any bonus features
